    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>It is a ritual among Satere-Mawe, a native tribe of
        the rainforest in Brazil, as an initiation rite 
        in order for boys to become men. The tribe 
        carries out the initiation by weaving bullet ants
        into a glove made out of leaves. A Satere elder
        blows smoke into gloves filled with bullet ants.
        A dozen young tribe members, with indigenous
        designs painted on their bodies, dance in a circle, 
        one of the tribe members eventually plunging his 
        hands into the bullet ant infest gloves. The bites 
        are deep and direct into the central nervous 
        ystem. After a time, he lets off a hurtful moan of
        pain, he withdraws from the chanting Indians dancing
         in a circle, he doesn't express agony as that 
         shows weakness. The bullet ant initiation also 
         known as Waumat, has been alive among the 
         Satere-Mawe for centuries, this rite of passage 
         is very important to the young tribe members and 
         are expected to be leaders to resist against 
         deforestation, land grabbers, and aging Bolsonro 
         who took over Brazil.</p>
    <h2>The Sting of the bullet ant</h2>
    <p>The bullet ant sting is one of the most painful 
        stings of any insect, the bullet Ant sting 
        contains neurotoxin. The stinger is located on 
        the ant’s abdomen and is 1-3mm long. One sting 
        from this pest can leave a person hurting for 8 
        hours, the pain is described as an intense and 
        lasting burning sensation, and is often 
        accompanied by sickness and vomiting.</p>
        <h2>Where does it take place</h2>
    <p>Fortaleza, Para, Brazil—The ceremony starts in the
        village of Fortaleza, on the Andira River. When
        boys reach the age of 13, they enter the jungle
        to find and harvest bullet ants that will be 
        used for the ceremony.</p>
    <h2>Religion</h2>
    <p>The Satere Mawe tribe are truly Christian’s, they 
        have chapels of mud and clay, and in the 1600-1700
        the Jesuits created Aldementos, missions among
        the Indians. In the article by Pime, the 
        indigenous people were rummaged through a 
        visitors bag saying, “We wanted to know if your 
        were a true missionary, We have seen that in 
        your briefcase there is the rosary, there is the
        chalice of the Mass, just as our elders had 
        told us”. This can tell us that they are truly
        Christian’s.</p>
